        The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John
        Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the
        greatest and most influential act of the rock era. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as
        "Beatlemania", but as the group\'s music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters
        Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by
        the era\'s sociocultural revolutions.</string>

        The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The first settled
        line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger
        (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts
        (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as occasional
        pianist until his death in 1985. Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his
        death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1975.
        Subsequently, Ronnie Wood has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman\'s
        departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has been the main bassist.</string>

        U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin. Formed in 1976, the group consists of Bono (vocals
        and guitar), the Edge (guitar, keyboards, and vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and
        Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums and percussion).[1] U2\'s early sound was rooted in post-punk but
        eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. Throughout
        the group\'s musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals.
        Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and
        sociopolitical concerns.</string>
    <string name="Page_4_Content">The Grateful Dead were an American rock band formed in 1965 in
        Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band was known for its unique
        and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock,
        improvisational jazz, psychedelia, space rock, for live performances of lengthy
        instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as "Deadheads". "Their
        music," writes Lenny Kaye, "touches on ground that most other groups don\'t even know
        exists." These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole
        that made the Grateful Dead "the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world".</string>

        The Velvet Underground was an American rock band, active between 1964 and 1973, formed in
        New York City. The group achieved little commercial success during its career, but is now
        recognized as one of the most important and influential of its era. The group was briefly
        managed by Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Silver Factory and Warhol\'s
        Exploding Plastic Inevitable events from 1966 to 1967. The provocative subject matter and
        often nihilistic attitudes explored in their music proved influential in the development
        of punk rock and alternative music.</string>
